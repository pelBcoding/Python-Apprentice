# 1. Create 3 variables, 1 each of String, int, and boolean
 
# 2. Write a for loop that prints the numbers 1-100 except numbers that are divisible by 7

# 3. Write a for loop that prints every other letter of the string you created in the 1st task

# 4.a Create a function that takes in 2 arguments, both integers, and returns the sum of those 2 arguments

# 4.b call the function from task 4.a
