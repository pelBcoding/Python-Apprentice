Copy the code from the previous lesson, 08a_More_Turtle_programs.ipynb, 
from the section "Change the Background Image"


Then change the code so that the turtle has a different image ( look in the 'images'
directory ) and moves to the corners of the screen in a square pattern.

# Change the Background Image

#Important:
# The image file can be a GIF or a PNG
# The image file must be in the `image` directory, and the  `image` directory
#  must be in the same directory as your program. 

#```python

import turtle

def set_background_image(window, image_name):
    """Set the background image of the turtle window to the image with the given name."""

    from pathlib import Path
    from PIL import Image


    image_dir = Path(__file__).parent / "images"
    image_path = str(image_dir / image_name)

    image = Image.open(image_path)
    
    window.setup(image.width, image.height, startx=0, starty=0)
    window.bgpic(image_path)

# Set up the screen
import turtle                           # Tell Python we want to work with the turtle
turtle.setup(width=600, height=600)     # Set the size of the window

tina = turtle.Turtle()                  # Create a turtle named tina

screen = turtle.Screen()                # Get the screen that tina is on
set_background_image(screen, "emoji.png") # Set the background image of the screen
